# max_buses

Thank you for purchasing my bus script!

Please read though the config files and set all options to your specific framework!

Make sure to run the max_buses.sql file in the SQL folder, and if you want a pre-configured route run the example_route.sql file as well.

If you have any questions just join my discord and make a ticket: https://discord.gg/6T3MGnPGC5

If you need to give you players keys for a vehicle then you can do this by creating an event handler for the server event "max_buses:spawnBus" the first argument will be the network id of the bus
